# Computer Vision
This directory focuses on computer vision (CV) models and tools, aiming to provide a range of resources to help users process and analyze image data. The goal is to offer ready-made solutions and frameworks to support tasks from basic image processing to complex visual recognition.

## Models and Frameworks
- **Pre-trained Models**: Includes, but is not limited to, CNN, ResNet, YOLO, etc., for various CV tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.
- **Image Generation**: Models for generating images, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), used in applications like art creation and data augmentation.
- **Visual Understanding**: Tools and models for deep analysis of image content, including feature extraction, scene understanding, and content recognition.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Image Preprocessing**: Scripts and libraries for image cleaning, normalization, and preprocessing, such as cropping, resizing, and color adjustments.
- **Feature Extraction**: Tools for extracting useful features from images, including edge detection, texture analysis, and color distribution.
- **Evaluation Tools**: Tools for evaluating model performance, including accuracy, recall, and Intersection over Union (IoU) calculations.
